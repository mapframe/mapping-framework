# mapping-framework

This framework is designed to allow support both to relational and document oriented databases for applications designed to handle documents. By building it in the shape of an integration system, we manage to provide to applications seamless read and write access to databases that are able to store documents.

Following the specificed rules we will show next in the usage example section, applications that manipulate complex data will not be tightly coupled with D.O. databases (the general choose of document-oriented aplications) instead, the transition from one storage technology to another (e.g. from D.O. databases to databases based on the relational model of data) could be accomplished without maintenance effort in the application/model layers.

## Usage example
